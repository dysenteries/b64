C library containing useful fast base64 related functions.

## Usage

### Get the library:
It's very simple to use it, run the "build_lib.sh" shell script and you will get the static library that you can use as you see fit:

```bash
bash build_lib.sh
```

### Run unit tests:

You can test the program very simply, thanks to the unit tests in the test directory.

To run the tests you just have to execute the shell script "build_test.sh" and all the tests will be done automatically:

```bash
bash build_test.sh
```

You can change the number of tests by directly modifying the value in the loop which is by default set to 500.

If there is any issue with the program, do not hesitate to report it.
